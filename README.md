Download the `Sime Wave v0.vcv` file from this repository. This is the patch for the rack.  

To run the patch, you'll need to download VCV rack. You can get it here:

[Click Here to download the latest VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/Rack#get)

The free version is what you're after.

Once installed, open the `Sime Wave v0.vcv` file from the application.

I've included instructions within the patch on how to operate it.

Cheers,
